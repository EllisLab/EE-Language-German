==================================

This license is a legal agreement between you and EllisLab, Inc. for the use of ExpressionEngine (all versions) Software (the “Software”).

ExpressionEngine Installations
------------------------------

An ExpressionEngine license purchase allows a single “live” installation in a production environment and ancillary “development use only” installations as needed to support the live installation (such as development and a staging servers). Additional installations require additional license purchases. If you have specific installation needs not covered by this license, please contact us (http://ellislab.com/about).

Permitted Use
-------------

*  Core License: Users of the Core License may use the Software ONLY on a website engaging in personal, non-commercial activities. Non-profit companies MAY NOT use the Core License.

*  Standard License: Users of the Standard purchased ExpressionEngine License may use the Software on a website engaging in commercial, personal, non-commercial, or non-profit activities. Websites engaging in direct or indirect commercial activities must purchase a Standard License.

Each installation may be used to power a single website. Using ExpressionEngine to run multiple sites requires a multi-site license, and all such sites must be wholly owned by the licensee.

EllisLab, Inc. will be the sole arbiter as to what constitutes commercial activities.
