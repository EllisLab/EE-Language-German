German Translation Pack for ExpressionEngine 4.x and 5.x
========================================================


- Copyright (C) 2009-2018 EllisLab, Inc.
- Original German translation provided by: Werner Gusset (gusset@octave2.ch)
- Erweitert f√ºr EE 3.x von Tom Jaisle (jaisle@eyelabel.com)
- Partly new translated and expanded for EE 3.x and EE 4.x by: Ralph Segert (ralph@segert.net)

Note from Ralph Segert:
The German language pack is translated to "modules_lang.php" for the EE 4.x and 5.x release.
I have strictly followed the order of the lines in the English language pack.
Thus, updating the language files is greatly facilitated.
